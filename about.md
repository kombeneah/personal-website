### Current Chapter

Very intrigued by the AI-wave we are currently riding, and always thinking about what ideas can really ride the tail end of the wave.

## People Who Influenced Me

Throughout my journey, I've been fortunate to learn from and be inspired by many people:

- Aldo Pacchiano
- Andrew Jones
- Evan Jones

## Values & Philosophy

I like to listen to perspectives, ideas, experiences or even mis-experiences, singularly to learn more about how we can make tomorrow better than today. A lot of situations in life are not fair, and the first step towardsmfixing that is learning about those situations, especially the ones we are least exposed to.
